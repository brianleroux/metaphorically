Metaphors rock.

## How to submit your metaphor

Create a pull request with either your addition to an existing metaphor or your
new metaphor in the following format:

```
[Topic] (matches the file name)
=======
> Definition from Google, MW, or wherever
>
><cite>from <a href="[address]">source</a></cite>

## A(n) [TOPIC] is [METAPHOR].
.

â€” [GITHUB_TWITTER_WHATEVER_HANDLE][1]

[1]:YOUR PREFERRED WEB ADDRESS
```

You can optionally include an image from a CC-compliant source, but
- restrain the image to less than 640 pixels
- use a `figure` tag, and
- include proper attribution.
