## A router is a telephone operator
In the "old days", you didn't dial someone directly, you lifted the handset and
asked the operator to connect you somewhere.  Telephone operators sat at large
switchboards and would quite literally connect you to someone else by plugging
your cord into the correct outlet.

A router does the same thing.  When websites want to be able to send a webpage
to your computer, the router connects the web server's message to your device,
(rather than someone else in your house).
