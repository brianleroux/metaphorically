## A router is a receptionist
When you connect a router to your modem, it takes the IP address of your modem
and gives everyone connected to it a private IP address that only it knows.
When you ask a web server for a web page, the router connects you, but the web
server only knows the "public" ip address.  When the web server responds with
your web page, only the router knows where to send that information.

If you were having a meeting with someone at an office, only the receptionist
knows where everyone sits and their phone numbers.  He or she would then send
your message to the person, rather than connect you directly.
