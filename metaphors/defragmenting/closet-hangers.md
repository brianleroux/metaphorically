## Defragmenting is moving empty hangers in your closet.
As people wear clothing in their closet, they tend to take an article from the
rod and leave the hanger in place.  As time passes, as you search for the next
item you want to wear, the hangers start getting in the way.

Then, when your laundry is ready to hang up, what do most people do?  Rather
than search through the hung clothing for a single hanger in which to hang one
of several items... you find all of the empty hangers and move them to one end.
This makes it easier to find space for your clothes.

Defragmenting a hard drive is the same idea.  As files are stored, they're
placed in empty space as it becomes available.  When you delete a file, the
space you've allocated for that file is freed, (an empty hanger).  Finding empty
space for your files begins to take longer and longer as time goes on.

When you defragment the hard drive, you move all of the empty space to one part
of the disk, making it easier for the computer to find space for your files,
(and make it easier for the disc to find it later!)
