## An IP Address is a telephone number.
While it looks complicated, an IP Address is nothing more than a unique number
to identify you on the Internet.  These numbers are assigned by your ISP, or,
if you have one, your router.

When you request a page from a web server, your request is marked as coming
from a specific address. When the response is ready, the web server sends it to
your specific number, much like you talking to someone over the phone.

## An IP Address is a mailing address.
Like a mailman delivering mail, an IP Address is how the Internet network knows
how to deliver responses from web servers and other devices directly to you.
